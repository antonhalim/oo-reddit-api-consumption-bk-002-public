     <p>Hi everyone, Barnaby here. I've just got back to the Al Jazeera headquarters after spending three weeks reporting from Central African Republic, where ongoing fighting between rival militia has left hundreds of thousands of people displaced.

Picture proof - [this is me!](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152250468503690&amp;set=a.10150243828793690.369310.7382473689&amp;type=1&amp;theater)

I'm here to answer your questions on the conflict and the difficulties of reporting from warzones - I've been a journalist since 1991 - ask me (almost) anything!

EDIT: that's all for now, as I have to go. I've really enjoyed answering so many interesting questions, and I apologise that I wasn't able to answer as many as I would have liked to. Thanks so much for your interest in CAR, which we'll carry on covering on Al Jazeera English.

Seriously this girl is ridiculously talented, and If you think 'well that's just the album', check out her live sessions, The songs are nuanced differently every time she plays them.

And read this fucking interview she did with FasterLouder.com about her album that's coming out this year, some of these contributors are just out of this world for a pop artist.

     <p>I'm actually amazed at how easy of a read it is. I was intimidated by it at first because of its size - it looks like a Game of Thrones book and those things took me a month each to read. But Dune is written so concisely - where Martin would take an whole page to describe a room, Herbert can describe an entire building in two sentences and still make you feel like you're there - that I'm flying through it. More has happened in 250 pages of Dune than happened in pretty much all of A Clash of Kings.

I'm really impressed with his character development. I'm always that freak who is drawn to villains and tries to find the good in them (I always believed in you Severus, from day one) and Dune is one of the few examples of books I've read where I am completely drawn to the good guys. I love Duke Leto, even his faults, and although I'm dreading his obviously foreshadowed death (NO SPOILERS it still hasn't happened!), I'm so excited to see what it's going to do to Paul, who is going to become SO. MUCH. MORE.

The only thing I'm a little disappointed with is the dialogue, but I feel like there's something I'm missing there. I have so many questions, but I don't want to look anything up because I'm afraid of accidentally spoiling myself.

This got a little long - all I originally wanted to do was ask about physical appearance of the characters: I picture Leto and Paul as being somewhat Middle Eastern looking, with Jessica looking more European. Besides the physical descriptions, I think a lot of the words they use have Arabic and Hebrew roots.

Also thought it was interesting that the Baron Harkonnen's name is Vladimir...considering Dune was published in 1965, I assume there are going to be major allusions to the Cold War...which I don't want to look up for fear of spoilers.

Also, how do you actually pronounce Bene Gesserit and Muad'Dib?

So many questions! Also PLEASE use [spoiler tags] :) Thanks!</p>
